## Set up Router

In this exercise, you will be creating a Single Page Application. There are 4 components in this exercise.

  - Home page
  - Contact page
  - About page
  - Navbar

### Task

* Install `react-router-dom`.
* Implement your knowledge of `<Router>`, `<Route>`, `<Link>` components from React Router to create the following routes:
    * `/home`
    * `/contact`
    * `/about`

* Each route in the `Navbar` should correspond to the respective page component.
    * Eg: Clicking on `About` link in the navigation bar should navigate the location to `/about` and the `About` component should render.
